# eulerMaruyama
A project to implement Euler Maruyama to solve a class of SDEs which includes the Black-Scholes equation. The src folder contains my initial python implementation, the haskell folder contains my attempt at solving the same problem in Haskell as a learning exercise.

# Running
To run the haskell variant use the usual stack commands.
